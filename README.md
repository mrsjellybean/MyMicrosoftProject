 So I'd like to create an app that can help u to choose after the small test what u can cook for yourself, as I and my friends usually face with a problem that noone can imagine what we should eat in the certain time.
 So I wanna make an app that will ask u about your preferences, allergies and products that u have at home, maybe also ask u about how much time u wanna spend cooking and after that show u a list with recepies or with some links to the external web-sites that contain recepies.
 I guess it might be cool to create something like that and also implement some gifs or fancy loader while the app processing all the recieved answers. :)
